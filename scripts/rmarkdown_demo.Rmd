## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

The mean of the data is `r mean(x)`.

f(x;\alpha,\beta) & = \mathrm{constant}\cdot x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1} \\[3pt]
& = \frac{x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}}{\displaystyle \int_0^1 u^{\alpha-1} (1-u)^{\beta-1}\, du} \\[6pt]
& = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}\, x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1} \\[6pt]
& = \frac{1}{Beta(\alpha,\beta)} x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}
\end{align}
